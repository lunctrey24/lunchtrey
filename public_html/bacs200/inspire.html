        <p>Odell Beckham Jr. is one of the most criticized athletes in all of sports today, but I find him very inspiring.  As an athlete, I know the pressure he feels, but I know he has a tremendous more amount than I do, but I can relate.  </p>
        <p>OBJ shows me how to enjoy the game everytime you're out on the field, no matter what the noise around him is saying about him.  Afterall, football still is just a game and it should always be fun.</p>
